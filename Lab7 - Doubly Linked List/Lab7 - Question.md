A. Write a C++ menu-driven program to implement List ADT using a doubly linked list. 
   Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. 
   The List ADT has the following operations,

    1. Insert Beginning
    2. Insert End
    3. Insert Position
    4. Delete Beginning
    5. Delete End
    6. Delete Position
    7. Search
    8. Display
    9. Display Reverse
    10. Exit

  What is the time complexity of each of the operations?

B. Write a C++ menu-driven program to implement a browser's front and back functionality. 
   Imagine that an integer number represents each webpage. Use the doubly linked list (DLL) to implement the List ADT as a header file. 
   Maintain proper boundary conditions and follow good coding practices. 
   The browser program has the following operations,
   
    1. New Webpage
    2. Front
    3. Back
    4. Exit

  Note: Maintain a current variable to keep track of the current active webpage. 
        The "New Webpage" operation inserts a new node after the current node and moves the current position to the newly inserted node.
        If there are any nodes following insertion, the nodes from the current + 1 till the end are deleted just like a web browser.
        The front option moves the current webpage to the next node.
        The back option moves the current webpage to the previous node.
